//What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
// parameters are a part of a function that is a place holder for 
// an argument to fill. The placeholder makes functions more Dynamic. An 
// argument is code that takes up the placeholders and makes functions do
//more things

//Within a function, what is the difference between return and console.log?
// They both log stuff to the console, except
// return is like console.log, but its on hold till its called. 
// console.log runs immediattly when its written. Fun fact if you console.log
// a console.log you will get an extra 'undefined' with your output.
